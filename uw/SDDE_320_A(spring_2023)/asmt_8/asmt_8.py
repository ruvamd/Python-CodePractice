'''
BFS of a Graph
Complete the function bfsOfGraph(V, AdjacencyList) which takes the 
integer V denoting the number of vertices and an adjacency list as 
input parameters and returns a list containing the BFS traversal of 
the graph starting from the 0th vertex from left to right.

DFS of a Graph
Complete the function dfsOfGraph(V, AdjacencyList) which takes the 
integer V denoting the number of vertices and an adjacency list as 
input parameters and returnsÂ a list containing the DFS traversal of 
the graph starting from the 0th vertex from left to right.
